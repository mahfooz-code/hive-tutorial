# type conversion

# implicit

  Primitive-type conversion from a narrow to a wider type is known as implicit conversion.

# explicit 
  
  Explicit-type conversion uses the CAST function with the CAST(value as TYPE) syntax.
  
  For example, CAST('100' as INT)
  
  If the cast fails, such as CAST('INT' as INT), the function returns NULL.
