# LOAD

# LOADING FROM LOCAL HOST
  The LOCAL keyword in the LOAD statement specifies where the files are located on the client host.
  If the LOCAL keyword is not specified, the files are loaded from the full Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) specified after INPATH (hdfs path) or the value from 
  the fs.default.name property defined in hdfs-site.xml by default.
